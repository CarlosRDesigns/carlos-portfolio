# The Portfolio of Carlos F Ruiz

## I have 3 goals when I'm working with a team
I work as collaboratively as possible. I'm strategic in my focus. I stay observant of the landscape and feedback I'm receiving.

## My background
I've been a designer for nearly 15 years focusing on visual design/UI, UX and overall design strategy. Throughout my career I've been able to work with companies like Microsoft, Cisco, Amazon Web Services (AWS), T-Mobile and Toyo Tires. 

I'm a Designer with a strategic focus, but I still setting type and building color palettes.:art:

While my main focus is on UX and UI design, the last few years have given me the opportunity to tackle more strategic problems and focus on information architecture, product management and work on the overall strategy of a given product. Right now I'm heading up a team that's working to establish a :triangular_ruler: Design System at a large UK charity. It's a huge task and there's so much change coming for the organization (from tech stacks to organizational changes) but it's really exciting and I'm loving the challenge.
