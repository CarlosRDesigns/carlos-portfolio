# The Portfolio of Carlos F Ruiz

## I have 3 goals when I'm working with a team
I work as collaboratively as possible. I'm strategic in my focus. I stay observant of the landscape and feedback I'm receiving.

## My background
I've been a designer for nearly 15 years focusing on visual design/UI, UX and overall design strategy. Throughout my career I've been able to work with companies like Microsoft, Cisco, Amazon Web Services (AWS), T-Mobile and Toyo Tires. 

I'm a Designer with a strategic focus, but I still know how to set type and build color palettes.
